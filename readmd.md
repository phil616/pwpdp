> Guiding principles for open source projects and big data privacy datasets for public benefit

The Public Welfare Project Development Principles (PWPDP in short) are a set of suggested principles for software project development and its development process that encourage public welfare.

In addition to the principle itself, it also includes some benefits that can be obtained by companies or project developers who adhere to this principle, as well as community norms.

The principle of public welfare project development is an encouraging principle and does not force restrictions on a certain project. The community also follows the principle of deletion over accusation.

## NOTICE

the PWPDP is still in draft, and the community is welcome to participate in the discussion and improvement of the PWPDP.
